--About the Project
This was originally a college project aimed at understanding how C works and what a typical C program looks like. It involves writing a simple text editor from scratch, providing a hands-on learning experience.
Getting Started
--To get started, you can work on a Linux system or install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on a Windows machine. The repository contains all necessary files, and I highly recommend following the tutorial linked above for detailed guidance.
